# Sorting Machine
This app is about using [Sorting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm). 
You can input any digits, letters or spacings to the field, app will drop everything but numbers and sort them from smallest to biggest by using 5 most popular algorithms. The trick is that different algorithms can cope with sorting for different time. It depends on how big numbers are and how much nubers do we have.
